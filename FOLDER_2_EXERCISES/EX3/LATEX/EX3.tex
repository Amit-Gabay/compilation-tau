\section{Introduction}
We continue our journey of building a compiler
for the invented object oriented language RioMare.
Remember that the entire specification of RioMare appears
inside the relevant folder of the course website.
In order to make this document self contained,
all the information needed to complete the third exercise is brought here again.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% SECTION :: Programming Assignment %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Programming Assignment}
The third exercise implements a semantic analyzer that
recursively scans the AST produced by
\href{http://www2.cs.tum.edu/projects/cup/}{CUP},
and checks if it contains any semantic errors.
The input for the semantic analyzer is a (single) text file containing a RioMare program,
and the output is a (single) text file indicating whether the input program
is semantically valid or not.
In addition to that, whenever the input program is valid semantically,
the semantic analyzer will add meta data to the abstract syntax tree,
which is needed for later phases (code generation and optimization).
The added meta data content will not be checked in exercises $3$,
but the best time to design and implement this addition is
exercise $3$.

\section{The RioMare Semantics}
This section describes the semantics of RioMare,
and provides a multitude of legal and illegal example programs.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% SUB-SECTION :: Types %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Types}
The RioMare programming language defines two native types: integers and strings.
In addition, it is possible to define a class by specifying its data members and methods.
Also, given an existing type \verb"T", one can define an array of \verb"T"'s.
Note, that defining classes and arrays is only possible in the uppermost (global) scope.
The exact details follow.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% SUB-SUB-SECTION :: Classes %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Classes}
\label{subsubsection_Classes}
Classes contain data members and methods,
and can only be defined in the uppermost (global) scope.
They can refer to/extend only previously defined classes,
to ensure that the class hierarchy has a tree structure.
Following the same concept,
a method \verb"M1" can \textit{not} refer to a method \verb"M2",
whenever \verb"M2" is defined after \verb"M1" in the class.
In contrast to all that,
a method \verb"M" \textit{can} refer to a data member \verb"d",
even if \verb"d" is defined \textit{after} \verb"M" in the class.
Table \ref{Table_Code_Examples_Use_Before_Def} summarizes these facts.

\paragraph{Methods overloading} is \textit{illegal} in RioMare,
with the obvious exception of overriding a method in a derived class.
Similarly, it is illegal to define a variable with the same name of
a previously defined variable (shadowing), or a previously defined method.

\paragraph{Inheritance} if class \verb"Son" is derived from class \verb"Father",

% SUB-SUB-SECTION :: Arrays %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Arrays}
\label{subsubsection_Arrays}
Arrays can only be defined in the uppermost (global) scope.
They are defined with respect to some previously defined type, as in the following example:
\[
\verb"ARRAY" ~ \verb"IntArray" ~ \verb"EQ" ~ \verb"int[]"
\]
Defining an integer matrix, for example, is possible as follows:
\[
\verb"ARRAY IntArray EQ int[] ARRAY IntMat EQ IntArray[];"
\]
In addition, any place in the program that semantically allows an expression of type array,
should semantically allow \verb"NULL" instead. For instance,
\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ | l | l | }
\hline
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\verb"ARRAY IntArray EQ int[]"               &    \\
\verb"void F(IntArray A){ PrintInt(A[8]); }" & OK \\
\verb"void main(){ F(NULL); }"               &    \\

\subsection{Asignments}
\label{subsection_Assignments}
Assigning an expression to a variable is clearly legal whenever the two have the same type.
In addition, following the concept in \ref{subsubsection_Classes},
if class \verb"Son" is derived from class \verb"Father",
then a variable of type \verb"Father" can be assigned an expression
of type \verb"Son".
Furthermore, following the concept in \ref{subsubsection_Classes} and \ref{subsubsection_Arrays},
assigning \verb"NULL" to array and class variables is legal.
In contrast to that, assigning \verb"NULL" to string variables is \textit{illegal}.
Table \ref{Table_Code_Examples_Assignments} summarizes these facts.

\subsection{Equality Testing}
\label{subsection_Equality_Testing}
Testing equality between two expressions is legal whenever the two have the same type.
In addition, following the same reason in \ref{subsection_Assignments},
if class \verb"Son" is derived from class \verb"Father",
then an expression  of type \verb"Father" can be
tested for equality with an expression of type \verb"Son".
Furthermore, any class variable,
string variable or array variable can be tested for equality with \verb"NULL".
The resulting type of a semantically valid comparison is the primitive type int.

The single exception to that is the $+$ binary operation,
that can be performed between integers \textit{and strings}.

% SECTION :: Input %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Input}
The input for this exercise is a single text file, the input RioMare program.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% SECTION :: Output %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Output}
The output is a \textit{single} text file that contains a \textit{single} word.
Either OK when the input program is correct semantically,
or otherwise ERROR(\textit{location}), where \textit{location}
is the line number of the \textit{first} error that was encountered.

\section{Submission Guidelines}
The skeleton code for this exercise resides (as usual)
in subdirectory EX3 of the course repository.
COMPILATION/EX3 should contain a makefile building your source files to a
runnable jar file called COMPILER (note the lack of the .jar suffix).
Feel free to use the makefile supplied in the course repository,
or write a new one if you want to. 
Before you submit, make sure that your exercise compiles and runs
on the school server: $nova.cs.tau.ac.il$.
This is the formal running environment of the course.

\paragraph{Execution parameters}
compiler receives $2$ input file names:\\ \\
InputRioMareProgram.txt\\
OutputStatus.txt
