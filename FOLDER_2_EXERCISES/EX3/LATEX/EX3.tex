\section{Introduction}
We continue our journey of building a compiler
for the invented object oriented language RioMare.
Remember that the entire specification of RioMare appears
inside the relevant folder of the course website.
In order to make this document self contained,
all the information needed to complete the third exercise is brought here again.

\section{Programming Assignment}
The third exercise implements a semantic analyzer that
recursively scans the AST produced by
\href{http://www2.cs.tum.edu/projects/cup/}{CUP},
and checks if it contains any semantic errors.
The input for the semantic analyzer is a (single) text file containing a RioMare program,
and the output is a (single) text file indicating whether the input program
is semantically valid or not.
In addition to that, whenever the input program is valid semantically,
the semantic analyzer will add meta data to the abstract syntax tree,
which is needed for later phases (code generation and optimization).
The added meta data content will not be checked in exercises $3$,
but the best time to design and implement this addition is
exercise $3$.

% SECTION :: RioMare Semantics %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{The RioMare Semantics}
This section describes the semantics of RioMare,
and provides a multitude of legal and illegal example programs.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% SUB-SECTION :: Types %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Types}
The RioMare programming language defines two native types: integers and strings.
In addition, it is possible to define a class by specifying its data members and methods.
Also, given an existing type \verb"T", one can define an array of \verb"T"'s.
Note, that defining classes and arrays is only possible in the uppermost (global) scope.
The exact details follow.
\paragraph{Arrays} can only be defined in the uppermost (global) scope.
They are defined with respect to some existing type, as in the following example:
\[
\verb"ARRAY" ~ \verb"IntArray" ~ \verb"EQ" ~ \verb"int[]"
\]
Defining an integer matrix, for example, is possible as follows:
\[
\verb"ARRAY IntArray EQ int[]; ARRAY IntMat EQ IntArray[];"
\]
\paragraph{Classes} contain data members and methods,
and can only be defined in the uppermost (global) scope.
They can refer to/extend only previously defined classes,
to ensure that the class hierarchy has a tree structure.
Following the same concept, method \verb"M1" can \textit{not} refer to method \verb"M2",
whenever \verb"M2" is defined after \verb"M1" in the class.
In contrast to all that, method \verb"M" \textit{can} refer to a data member \verb"d",
even if \verb"d" is defined \textit{after} \verb"M" in the class.
Table \ref{Table_Code_Examples_Use_Before_Def} summarizes these facts.

On a similar note, it is illegal for a class to have a variable with the same name
as an existing method, or an existing variable.
So, all examples in Table \ref{Table_Code_Examples_Variables_With_The_Same_Name} are illegal.

The skeleton code for this exercise resides (as usual)
in subdirectory EX3 of the course repository.
COMPILATION/EX3 should contain a makefile building your source files to a
runnable jar file called COMPILER (note the lack of the .jar suffix).
Feel free to use the makefile supplied in the course repository,
or write a new one if you want to. 
Before you submit, make sure that your exercise compiles and runs
on the school server: $nova.cs.tau.ac.il$.
This is the formal running environment of the course.
