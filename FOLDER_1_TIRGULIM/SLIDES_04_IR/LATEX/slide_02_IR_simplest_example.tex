\begin{itemize}
\item Consider the simple expression: \textit{32765+8}.
\item IR is produced by scanning the AST recursively as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item First, the left subtree (a leaf actually) is scanned,
      producing the IR command: \textbf{li Temp\_29, 32765}.
\item Then, the right subtree (a leaf too) is scanned,
      producing the IR command: \textbf{li Temp\_30, 8}.
\item Finally, the binop father node uses the temporaries
      returned from its operand sons to produce the IR command:\\
      \textbf{add Temp\_31, Temp\_29, Temp\_30}.
\end{itemize}

\item Note that the IR recursive scan of the AST
      resembles the scan performed by the semantic analyzer.
      However here expression subtrees return their temporary,
      not their type.
